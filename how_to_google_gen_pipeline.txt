# How to build a custom docker image, and run a custom script with
# Google Genomics Pipelines

# 1.  I searched hub.docker.com for 'bioconductor' to get some examples.

# 2. We can build off another defined file

# 3. I'm going to revise this docker file:
# https://github.com/NESCent/popgen-docker
# I'm going to edit that file, by:
# -- changing the Maintainer.
# -- remove the gsl install part.
# -- changes the R package installs
# -- adding my own package install from my github repo

4.
